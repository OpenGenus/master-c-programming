Title: **Master C Programming with Practical Projects: 6 weeks track to mastery**

This is the **only book you need to master C Programming Language practically**.

There is no use if you know a Programming Language but struggle to implement tools. This is a problem with majority of programmers today. This book is specially designed to help you master C as your first programming language and learn it in a practical approach by:

* Learn the core fundamentals of C Programming Language.
* Implement major projects in C from scratch.

This book is designed in a form of a **bootcamp**. It is split into **6 weeks** and chapters for **5 days a week**.<br>
Each week:

* 2 days a week is kept off so that you can relax and revise the previous topics of that week. Expertise takes time and these 2 days a week serve this purpose.
* 5th day of every week is kept for practical only. We implement C programs on this day which are of increasing complexity as we process through the weeks.
* The 6th week focusses only on Practical projects.
